          <li>

        <li>How to Make Strawberry Cake:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer (or stand
            mixer), beat together 2 eggs with 1 cup sugar on high speed for 5
            minutes or until light in color and thick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup oil, 1 tsp vanilla and beat on low
            speed until well combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, whisk together: 2 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder
            and 1/4 tsp salt until well incorporated. With the mixer on med/low
            speed, add flour mixture to the batter 1/3 at a time, letting the
            flour incorporate with each addition and continue mixing just until
            well combined. Do not over-mix.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour half of the batter into prepared pan. Top with 6 oz of diced
            strawberries then spread remaining batter over the top. Cover the
            surface with 6 oz of halved strawberries (cut-side-down), pressing
            them down just slightly into the batter. Bake at 375˚F for 45-55
            minutes (mine was perfect at 50 min), or until a toothpick inserted
            into center comes out clean. Let cake rest in pan 15-20 min then
            remove ring and cool to room temp or until just lightly warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run a thin spatula around cake edges to loosen from pan. then
            transfer to a cake platter. Cool until just warm or at room
            temperature. To serve, dust with powdered sugar if desired. Drizzle
            individual slices generously with strawberry syrup.
          </li>

        <li>How to Make Strawberry Sauce:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While the cake is baking, make the strawberry sauce: In a blender or
            food processor, combine 16 oz strawberries and 1/4 cup sugar (or add
            sugar to taste) and blend until pureed.
